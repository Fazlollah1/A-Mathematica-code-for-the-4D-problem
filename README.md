Numerical investigation of high-dimensional option pricing PDEs by utilizing a new hybrid radial basis function - finite difference procedure
This code represents the results of the proposed method named as GMQRBF-FD in the paper for $c=3\max{Subscript[s, ij]}$. The program investigates the 4D case which would be useful for the results showed in Table 1. Noting that, the notations used here, are not necessarily the same as the notations used in the paper.
